Networking Basics

## Key Concepts
- **IP Address:** Unique identifier for a device on a network.
- **Subnet Mask:** Defines the network and host portions of an IP address.
- **Gateway:** Device that routes traffic from a local network to other networks.
- **DNS (Domain Name System):** Translates domain names to IP addresses.
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices.

## Protocols
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Reliable, connection-oriented protocol.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Faster, connectionless protocol.
- **HTTP/HTTPS:** Protocols for web traffic.
- **FTP:** File Transfer Protocol.
- **SSH:** Secure Shell for encrypted remote access.

## OSI Model Layers (Brief)
1. Physical  
2. Data Link  
3. Network  
4. Transport  
5. Session  
6. Presentation  
7. Application  

## Common Commands
- `ping` – Test connectivity to another device.
- `tracert` / `traceroute` – Trace the path packets take to a destination.
- `ipconfig` / `ifconfig` – View network configuration on Windows/Linux.
- `nslookup` – Query DNS records.
